    <h2>ASV AIRPORT Shuttle</h2>
    <p>As an extension of its exclusive “Pampered Camping” amenities, Adventure Sun Valley offers Guests complimentary shuttle service in our very nice air-conditioned motor coach to and from the Boise Airport. We will meet all guests at the Boise Airport at 3:30 pm on the day before the launch for the drive to Stanley in time for the orientation meeting. At the end of the trip we will depart Stanley the day after getting off the trip for Boise at 7 am. Plan on arriving at the Boise Airport at approximately 11am. Special details may be arranged well in advance.</p>

    <h2>By Car</h2>
    <p>The closest town to our launch site just happens to be charming Stanley, Idaho, located on Highway 75, off of Interstate 84, 140 miles north of Twin Falls. If you have time, the drive in from any direction is extremely scenic.</p>

    <h2>By Air and Rental car</h2>
    <p>Many guests fly into Boise or Sun Valley, rent a car for the week (starting around $240), and drive to and from Stanley.</p>

    <h2>By Air TAXI</h2>
    <p>Other guests choose to fly on a commercial airline into Boise or Sun Valley and then continue on with a two-way ticket on a small air taxi into Stanley and out of Salmon (near our beginning and ending points). The air taxi ticket costs around $360/person and must be booked well in advance. The air taxi will save you about 8 total hours on the road, as well as the cost of renting a car, and possibly even one night’s lodging at the end of the trip.</p>
